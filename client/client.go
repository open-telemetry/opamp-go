	// Start may immediately return an error if the settings are incorrect (e.g. the
	// serverURL is not a valid URL).

	// Start does not wait until the connection to the server is established and will
	// likely return before the connection attempts are even made.

	// It is guaranteed that after the Start() call returns without error one of the
	// following callbacks will be called eventually (unless Stop() is called earlier):
	//  - OnConnectFailed
	//  - OnError
	//  - OnRemoteConfig

	// Start should be called only once. It should not be called concurrently with
	// any other OpAMPClient methods.

	// May be called only once.
	// After this call returns successfully it is guaranteed that no
	// callbacks will be called. Stop() will cancel context of any in-fly
	// callbacks, but will wait until such in-fly callbacks are returned before
	// Stop returns, so make sure the callbacks don't block infinitely and react
	// promptly to context cancellations.
	// Once stopped OpAMPClient cannot be started again.

	// in the next status report sent to the server.

	// Start() method is exactly the same as for SetAgentAttributes() method.
	// Note that this is one of the 3 ways the effective config can be updated on the
	// server. The other 2 ways are:
	//   1) via StartSettings before Start()
	//   2) by returning an effective config in OnRemoteConfig callback.
